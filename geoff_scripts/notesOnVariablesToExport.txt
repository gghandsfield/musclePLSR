go through ipnode file and grab the X coordinate and all derivatives, Y coordinate and all derivatives, and Z coordinate and all derivatives
This will give you 24 variables
Do this for all 36 simulations

Create a 36x24 matrix

This is the response matrix for geometry...

The predictor matrix is the length and activation (more on this later)
