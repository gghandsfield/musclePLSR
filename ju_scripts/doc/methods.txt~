*Prediction of muscle geometry and mechanics from length and activation

**Aim
- Train a statistical model for predicting muscle geometry, stress, and strain from muscle length and activation level.

**Training set
36 FE simulations (observations) with 2 independent and 54 dependent variables.

***Independent Variables
-muscle length scalar (6 levels)
-activation level scalar (6 levels)

*Dependent Variables
- muscle geometry: 3*8 (CH coordinates) = 24
- muscle stress - principal vectors (9), principal stresses (3), scalars (3) = 15
- muscle strain - principal vectors (9), principal stresses (3), scalars (3) = 15

*Methods

**Data extraction:
Function for constructing 36 x 2 X array
Function for contructing 36 x m Y array. User selects data to be included in Y. Data options: geometry, stress, or strain.

**Statistical Model:
1. PLSR regression of length and activation (X, 36x2) against geometric, stress, and strain nodal parameters (Y, 36x76)

**Ouput:
- Predicted geometry: overwrite coord values in input ipnode file
- Predicted stress and strain: overwrite fields in input exnode file
