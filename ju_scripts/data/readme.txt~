The gastrocnemius muscle is of original length 380mm (38cm) and is elongated by 2cm during foot dorsiflexion.

The lengths are labelled as L1..L6 with:

L1 380
L2 384
L3 388 
L4 392
L5 396
L6 400

At each length the muscle is activated to produce a contraction with activation levels given by A1..A6:

A1 0.0
A2 0.2
A3 0.4
A4 0.6
A5 0.8 
A6 1.0

where A1 is no activation (passive only) and A6 is maximal activation.

These values can be used in the multivariate regression.
