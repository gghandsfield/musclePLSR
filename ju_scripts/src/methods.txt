*Prediction of muscle geometry and mechanics from length and activation

**Aim
- Train statistical models for predicting muscle geometry, stress, and strain from muscle length and activation level.
- Quantify prediction accuracy by leave-one-out tests.

**Training set
36 FE simulations (observations) with:

***Independent Variables
- muscle length scalar (6 levels)
- activation level scalar (6 levels)

***Dependent Variables
- muscle geometry: 3*8 (CH nodal parameters) = 24
- muscle stress at gauss points - principal vectors (9), principal stresses (3), scalars (3) = 15
- muscle strain at gauss points - principal vectors (9), principal stresses (3), scalars (3) = 15

**Methods
- N x 2 predictor array (X) of muscle lengths and activation levels, where N is the number of simulations.
- N x M response array (Y). M is 24 for geometry, and 15 for stress and strain.
- PCA was performed on Y to explore the main modes of variation of the response data. Scatter plots of principal component scores were used to visualise the scatter of data and identify outliers.
- three simulations were discarded since they were shown by the exploratory PCA to be extreme outliers. The simulations had length/activation combinations of (392, 1.0), (388, 1.0), (384, 1.0).
- 3 sets of leave one out experiment were run to test the accuracy of PLSR for predicting geometry, stress, and strain, respectively.
- Each set of L1O experiments were composed of 33 tests. 
- In each test, the PLSR model was trained on N=35 experiments, and one experiment was used to test the prediction. 
- PLSR model trained on length and activation (X) against geometric, stress, or strain variables (Y). PLSR subroutine provided by sklearn python package (http://scikit-learn.org/0.12/modules/pls.html) [1].
- The left out muscle and length and activation was given to the PLSR model to predict the response. The predicted response was compared to the actual response to calculated an RMS error. All 36 simulations were left out, predicted, and its error quantified in turn.

**Results:
- Average L1O RMS errors: 0.068 for geometry, 0.29 for stress, 0.27 for strain.
- PCA scatterplot for the first 2 pcs of the geometry PCA showed a distint grid-like pattern. This suggests that muscle length and activation produce orthogonal variations in muscle geometry. This makes sense since muscle length is orthogonal to muscle width (bulging) which is affected by activation level.
- PCA scatterplot for the first 2 pcs of the geometry PCA showed a warped grid pattern suggesting stress patterns are affected non-linearly by length and activation. It also suggests that L400A1.0 could be anomalous.
- PCA scatterplot for the first 2 pcs of the geometry PCA showed strain patterns distributed in a very clear parabolic shape. This suggest a strong non-linear relationship between length/activation and strain.
- Both stress and strain PCA scatterplots show non-linear patterns and suggest that non-linear statistical method may achieved better dimension reduction and prediction accuracy.
